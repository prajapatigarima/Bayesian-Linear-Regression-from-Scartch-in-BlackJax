# Bayesian-Linear-Regression-from-Scartch-in-BlackJax

We have to make Bayesian Linear Regression from scartch using BlackJax sampling method.

I started the task by searching more information abput BlackJax and Bayesian Linear Regression.

Here's what I came across:
   
   # What is BlackJax?
    It is a sampler for JAX that works both on CPU AND GPU. BlackJAX is an MCMC sampling library based on JAX. 
    
    BlackJAX provides well-tested and ready to use sampling algorithms: 
    It is also explicitly designed to be modular: 
    it is easy for advanced users to mix-and-match different metrics, integrators, trajectory integrations, etc.

   # What is Bayesian Linear Regression?
    
    In statistics, Bayesian linear regression is an approach to linear regression in which the statistical analysis is undertaken within the context of Bayesian inference. When the regression model has errors that have a normal distribution, and if a particular form of prior distribution is assumed, explicit results are available for the posterior probability distributions of the model's parameters.
